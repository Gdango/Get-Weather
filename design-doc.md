## Overview:
This app will update user via text when it will rain within the next 4 days.  Per Environmental Pollution Agency (EPA), dischargers are required to sample each rain event (at least twice every 6 months) and execute the promised Best Management Practice.  Because it does not rain as often at some places, especially Los Angeles, dischargers could lose track of the upcoming rain event.  Missing a sampling event could become an issue for dischargers since that is a regulatory requirement.  It is especially important for the dry region as missing one event could put the company at risk of a regulatory violation.

Though the motivation of this app was driven by the regulatory purpose, this could be used to remider the users of the rain event as well.
